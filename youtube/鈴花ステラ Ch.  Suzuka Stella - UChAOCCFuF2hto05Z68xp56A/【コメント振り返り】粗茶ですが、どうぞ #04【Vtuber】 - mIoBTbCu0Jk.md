Now, let’s get started!!

The time of “Have a cup of tea”!!

In this corner, to tell listeners thanks, I’ll look back past streaming and read the comments that I missed.

This time, I’ll look back “I’ll fascinated you with fairly’s guts! Penalty game? a...I’ll fight back!”

Now, let’s read comments!!



0:42 First comment is this!

Comment: “This writer is rare Suzudomo. This guy must be natural treasure.”

I agree... Stella knew that there are still alive gentle Suzudomo!

Because!! Other marshmallows which suggested penalty games were “eating extremely hot food” or “mimic someone”...a kind of too hard things to do!!

I can understand your feelings. I want to say same words too! lol

I believe “There is still alive gentle Suzudomo!”

Then, “Have a Cup of Tea”!!



1:24 The next comment is this!

Comment: “[Announce] Stella’s English Skill Level is 1 upped!!”

(Giggle)When I was doing penalty game, I got comment from a foreigner and it said “Don’t worry”, and I could read it!! At this moment, I was boosting it everyone!! My English is getting better, so you should expect me!

Then, “Have a Cup of Tea”!!



2:02 The next comment is this!

Comment: “Is it chocolate...? It’s not a big deal for me tho!!”

(Giggling)When Stella in the mood to do voice acting penalty game, I had eaten extremely hot Peyoung(Japanese famous instant noodle). And I was talking about making extremely hot chocolate, I couldn’t speak clearly cause I ate spicy food.

So I wanted to say “Giri chocolate(=Obligatory chocolate)”, but I said “Geri chocolate(=Diarrhea chocolate)!lol

So I think someone gave this comment! Sorry!!

Then “Have a Cup of Tea”!!



2:57 Next!!

Comment: “Extremely hot chocolate makes someone understand clearly it is Obligatory chocolate!!”

I think extremely hot chocolate is OK if it is delicious. You don’t like it? Suzudomo don’t like it? lol

Then “Have a Cup of Tea”!!



3:24 Today’s last comment is this!!

Comment:Su-chan(Stella‘s nickname) is always cute!!”

Thank you!!

Everyone recognizes me cute style, cute voice, and nice body girl! So it’s natural that someone comment it!

Then “Have a Cup of Tea”!!



4:02 Guys! Thank you for comment a lot!!

I knew it, but when I was looking back my streaming archive, there are many funny comments that I couldn’t read! I enjoyed to read it!

Then I’ll post “Have a Cup of Tea” on next Monday, so don’t miss it!

Otsu-sute(goodbye greetings)! Bye bye!
