Now, let’s get started!!

The time of “Have a Cup of Tea”!!

In this corner, to tell listeners thanks, I’ll look back past streaming and read the comments which I missed.

This time, I’ll look back “[Valentines Day]Special program! Chatting in the Sweet night!?”

Now, let’s read comments!!



0:46 First comment is this!

Comment: “Happy Van Allentie’s day!(Van Allen radiation belt)”(In this case,”Tie(帯)” means “belt” in Japanese and it sounds like “Valen{tines} Day”)

(In simple words, it’s Japanese joke)
